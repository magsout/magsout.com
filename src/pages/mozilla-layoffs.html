    <div class="blog">
      Like many, I learned of the lay offs of 250 employees from Mozilla on
      August 11, 2020. That's about a quarter of the workforce. These layoffs
      come 8 months after a first round of layoffs in January for another 70
      employees.

    <div class="blog">
      I am an early adopter of the Firefox browser. I've been using it almost
      since the beginning. I failed in my mission around version 3.6 by
      switching to Chromium. It was short because I came back when I switched
      from Firefox version 4.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
      Of course when we talk about Mozilla we think of Firefox, but it's
      actually much more. It's the biggest online documentation of the web with
      MDN, a dedicated privacy advocate, a strong desire to make the web a safe
      space.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">At least that's how I see Mozilla.</div>
    <div class="blog">
      As I read and discussed the layoffs, a fear came over me.
    </div>

    <div class="blog">
      The devtools team is reduced, as well as the MDN writer team, no more
      WebXR, servo etc. team. The list is not exhaustive but it is what stood
      out to me the most.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">What is the future for Mozilla?</div>

    <div class="blog">
      I don't read between the lines, so I can't answer that question.
      Especially since I don't necessarily understand Mozilla's choices and
      strategy. Even if sometimes it is necessary to take difficult decisions in
      order to become smaller and reborn stronger.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
      Although it's necessary to have a real strategy.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
      One of the risks would clearly be that Mozilla will do like Opera in 2013
      by switching from Presto to Blink, then recently Internet Explorer (Edge)
      which also made the choice to leave its internal engine EdgeHTML for Blink
      in December 2018. A monoculture is never good, whatever the domain is.
      Healthy competition is always better and inspires innovation. Especially
      when one of the players does not want to make the web a trusted space. I
      intentionally mix engine, browser and company, but it's done on purpose.
      Of course this is only extrapolation and exaggeration. I don't think
      Mozilla will come to this. Although I have read articles in the press
      claiming the opposite, nothing announces the death of Mozilla. There are
      still a lot of its employees, very talented engineers at Mozilla.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
      I've seen a lot of tweets, messages asking how to help Mozilla. For many,
      donations seem to be the answer. Except that even though it's important
      (we must continue to give), it's the Mozilla Foundation that receives
      donations, not the Mozilla corporation. Most employees are on MoCo
      contracts.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
      But then what wan we do? I was talking to a friend at Mozilla's the other
      day. His answer was clear: promote the use of Firefox. If I quote his
      answer: the main thing at the moment is still the market share of Firefox.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
      Mozilla's main revenues come from contracts with search engines such as
      Google. Firefox defaults to Google as a search engine. Google pays for
      this. The market share is of course important in these contracts.
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
      Mozilla is trying to diversify out of this financial dependence. Pocket,
      which was acquired in February 2017, has a
      <a href="https://getpocket.com/premium?ep=1" title="See pocket premium"
        >premium offer</a
      >. Mozilla has also launched its own
      <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/" title="See VPN service">VPN</a>. For
      the moment the service is limited to some countries, but a roadmap is
      intended to expand this list.
